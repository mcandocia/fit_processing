# Converting Garmin FIT to CSV (and GPX to CSV)

[article for original version](https://maxcandocia.com/article/2017/Sep/22/converting-garmin-fit-to-csv/)

Requirements:

 * Python 3.5+

 * BeautifulSoup

 * fitparse (installation instructions below)

 * tzwhere (to localize timezones)

 * pytz (to localize timezones)

 * numpy (to calculate workout variables)

 * FIT files to convert (if using that feature)

 * GPX files to convert (if using that feature)

First, install `fitparse`

    sudo pip3 install -e git+https://github.com/dtcooper/python-fitparse#egg=fitparse

OR

    sudo pip3 install fitparse

Then you can execute `process_all.py`

    python3 process_all.py --subject-name=mysubjectname --fit-source-dir=/media/myname/GARMIN/Garmin/ACTIVITY/

This will create a bunch of CSVs for all of your workouts in that directory. The files will be stored in a `subject_data` directory's subdirectory (check the defaults for the specific folders), which is generated based off the subject name. Up to 3 files are made per FIT file:

 1. A CSV of all of the track data

 2. A CSV of the lap data

 3. A CSV of the start (and stop) data

Each of the CSVs is in the format '{activity_type}_YY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS[_{laps,starts}].csv.

You can also provide a csv to censor certain geographic regions by latitude, longitude, and radius. Simply create a CSV with `longitude`, `latitude`, and `radius` column headers, and add as many circular regions as you want. Note that radius is assumed to be in meters.

    
    python3 process_all.py --subject-name=mysubjectname --fit-source-dir=/media/myname/GARMIN/Garmin/ACTIVITY/ --censorfile=/home/mydir/censor.csv --censor

This will be stored in a folder called `"censored"` that is in the subject's directory. You can use the `--censor-string=` to change what censored fields are replaced with (default is `[CENSORED]`).

You can also archive the data after it's been processed:

    python3 process_all.py --subject-name=mysubjectname --fit-source-dir=/media/myname/GARMIN/Garmin/ACTIVITY/ --censorfile=/home/mydir/censor.csv --censor --archive-results

By default, this stores data in a directory called `archives` in the main `subject_data` folder. You can add the `--archive-censored-only`, which will only archive the censored folder.

## GPX data

You can also process GPX data (and censor it the same way as FIT data)

For the initial processing, you can do

    python3 process_all.py --subject-name=mysubjectname --skip-fit-conversion gpx-source-dir=/home/mydir/gpx_files

By default, the program will always try to copy/process FIT files unless you add the `--skip-fit-conversion` flag, but you can always tweak the code to your needs.

## Additional Help

You can use `python3 process_all.py --help` to see more information.
